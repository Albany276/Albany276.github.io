                <h3>Quirky Bio</h3>
                <p> Hello! </p>
                <p> Thanks for visiting my page.</p> 
                <p> I was born and raised in Venezuela, but currently living in sunny Brisbane, Australia.</p> 
                <p> I am an Engineer by day, managing technology projects in the mining industry, and a programmer by
                    night.</p> 
                <p> I took an interest in programming because it gives me the ability to quickly see the tangible results of
                    my work (like this website!).</p> 
                <p> This is only beginning of my programming journey, feel free to explore my portfolio (from HTML,
                    python, react to Django) or get in touch for a chat or coffee.</p> 
                <p> When I am not at work or programming, I love to read, hike, travel, and spend time with my partner
                    and crazy dog.</p>
                <p> In the near future, I would like to explore using my programming skills to volunteer and give back to
                    the community, so stay tuned; this is only the beginning of something awesome. </p>
